## Recent Devlog Updates
(All DevLog Updates can be found in the [DevLog Folder](https://github.com/RottenThunder/Project-Ember/tree/master/DevLog))

### Day 5 (19/10/2021)
- Commit "OpenGL Window!!!"
    - Used OpenGL to create a cross-platform window to render graphics to
    - OpenGL's Library can be found [here](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)

### Day 8 (22/10/2021)
- Commit "Event System and Proper Window Class"
    - Created an Event System to handle events (such as the window resizing and whether a certain key on a keyboard is pressed)
    - Implemented a proper Window Class so making a window on different platforms shouldn't be too hard
    - Note: Events actually do not take effect, so the window does not close when the user presses the close button. A quick fix for this is to close the console window instead
- Commit "All Events are Dispatching!"
    - All Events are now dispatching, so the window actually closes now
